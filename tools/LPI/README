How to use predict and retrain function?
0.Make sure the file under "Capsule_LPI_sources/data/tools" has sufficient permissions.
chmod -R 777 tools

1. Prepare fasta files that contain all the lncRNAs and proteins' sequences used in prediction.(See example at Capsule_LPI_sources\data\user_data\fasta_data)
And if you want to retrain the model, the fasta files also need contain all the lncRNAs and proteins'sequences used in retrain.
Put them into  Capsule_LPI_sources\data\user_data\fasta_data

2. If you want to retrain the model, you need to prepare retrain pairs files. (See example at Capsule_LPI_sources\data\user_data\retrain_pairs_data)
Put them into Capsule_LPI_sources\data\user_data\retrain_pairs_data

3. If you want to make prediction, the lncRNAs and proteins in rna_fasta_file and pro_fasta_file (prepare in step 1), respectively, will form lncRNA-protein pairs one by one.
You can also assign specific pairs to predict. In this way, you need to prepare predict pairs file. (See example at Capsule_LPI_sources\data\user_data\predict_pairs_data)
Put it into Capsule_LPI_sources\data\user_data\predict_pairs_data

4. Adjust the parameters at "if __name__ == '__main__':" in main.py to work.
For example:
If you want to make prediction, set the parameters as follow:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Prepare fasta files of lncRNAs and proteins that contain all the lncRNAs and proteins used in prediction and
    # retraining.(See README)
    rna_fasta_file_name = "example_lncRNA.fa"  # Enter the name of your file
    pro_fasta_file_name = "example_protein.fa"  # Enter the name of your file


    # If you want to retrain the model, you need to prepare retrain pairs files. (See README)
    RETRAIN = False  # choose: True, False
    retrain_interacting_pairs_file_name = "example_interacting_pairs"  # Enter the name of your file
    retrain_uninteracting_pairs_file_name = "example_negative_pairs"  # Enter the name of your file


    # If you want to make prediction, set "PREDICT = True". And the lncRNAs and proteins in "rna_fasta_file_name" and
    # "pro_fasta_file_name", respectively, will form lncRNA-protein pairs one by one.
    PREDICT = True  # choose: True, False
    predict_output_file_name = "example_output"  # Enter the name of your file
    USE_RETRAIN_MODEL = False   # choose: True, False  (If you have retrained the model, you can choose True.)
    # You can also assign specific pairs to predict. In this way, you need to prepare predict pairs file. (See README)
    predict_designated_pairs = False
    predict_pairs = "example_predict_pairs"  # Enter the name of your file


    # When a complete feature extraction is performed once, the feature file is saved. This option can be set to False
    # to accelerate prediction or retrain.
    EXTRACT_FEATURES = True  # choose: True, False
